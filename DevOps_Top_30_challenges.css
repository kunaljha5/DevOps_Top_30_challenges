The top 30 DevOps challenges

With so many organizations considering the practical aspects of making DevOps work, I decided to dig into data captured from more than 100 DevOps workshops to identify the most common recurring challenge areas. Here are the top 30:

    Environment provisioning
    Manual testing
    No DevOps center of excellence
    Test data
    Manual deployments
    Planning in a DevOps environment
    DevOps and suppliers
    DevOps and governance
    No integrated tools architecture
    Manual releases
    No DevOps metrics
    DevOps and team composition
    DevOps and regulatory compliance
    No service virtualization
    DevOps and specialist skills
    Traceability across the DevOps landscape
    Large releases
    Inconsistent environments
    Agile confined to developers
    Limited transparency
    Manual processes
    Collaboration between development and operations
    No DevOps vision or strategy
    No production-like environments
    Waste in existing processes
    Limited customer feedback
    Elicitation of nonfunctional requirements
    Collaboration across all IT disciplines
    Collaboration between business and IT
    No standard SCM repository

This list of challenges is a mixed bag, for several reasons:

    There is overlap (for example, between manual testing and manual processes).
    Some challenges focus on people (no DevOps center of excellence), some on process (planning in a DevOps environment), and some on technology (environment provisioning).
    Others focus on the enterprise (DevOps and suppliers) rather than a team (elicitation of nonfunctional requirements).

Even so, the list gives you an idea of what to look for when examining your own DevOps adoption. But donâ€™t treat it as a checklist. Every organization has its own unique challenges, and your greatest challenge may not even be on this list.
